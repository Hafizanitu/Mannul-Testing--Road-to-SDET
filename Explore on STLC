✅ Requirements Assurance
Review all requirements thoroughly.Ensure there are:
1.No typos2.No missing or partial requirements 3.All related documents (artifacts) are included.
📘 User Stories in QA--Define features from an end-user perspective. QA reads stories to:Understand acceptance criteria .Extract test conditions.Prioritize and create test cases
STLC – Software Testing Life Cycle
1. Test Planning
Define scope, strategy, and resources.QA Manager's responsibility.Senior QA analyzes risk factors.
2. Test Analysis (What to Test)
Deeply understand features and acceptance criteria.Note down key points.Prioritize test cases based on user stories.
3. Test Design (How to Test)
Write detailed test cases:Include positive & negative scenarios.Add test data.A form of static testing (before code runs)
4. Test Implementation
Prepare all testing resources:Test cases,Test data,Environment.Set priority of test cases.
Perform:
Smoke testing: Basic, high-impact features
Regression testing: All existing features
Group test cases into test suites
5. Test Execution
Run the test cases.Record actual vs expected results.Log and track defects
6. Test Completion
Ensure all planned tests are done
Document:Test summary.Defect statistics.Final report and lessons learned
🔧 SDLC vs STLC – Comparison
Software Development Life Cycle  	    Software Testing Life Cycle
Covers full software process         	Focused only on testing stages
Phases: Req → Design → Dev → Deploy  	Phases: Req → Planning → Execution
Ensures product is built	            Ensures product is tested

 SDLC Models Overview
1. Sequential Models
Waterfall: One phase after another.
V-Model: Verification and validation in parallel.
2. Iterative Models
Spiral, Prototyping: Repeated cycles to refine product.
3. Incremental Models
RAD (Rapid Application Development): Develop small functional modules quickly.
4. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Pilot version of the product with core functionalities for user feedback.
🧪 Testing Approaches
🔁 TDD – Test-Driven Development
Write tests before development.Focused on dynamic testing
✅ ATDD – Acceptance Test-Driven Development.Create acceptance test cases early.Helps in faster validation
💬 BDD – Behavior-Driven Development.Understand user behavior
Use Gherkin syntax: Given – When – Then
👥 Testing Roles
QA Manager / Lead: Planning, assigning tasks, analyzing risks
QA Engineer / Tester:
Design & execute test cases
Identify bugs
Do regression testing
Maintain test documentation
